## Finished The Basics

After a week and a half learning about matrices, vectors and making my own 3D maths library I have finally finished the basics of OpenGL. Of course, this is not the end of the road since I will be doing much more projects and experiments on OpenGL.
Currently i'm planning to make a few small games or experiment with other libraries for OpenGL such as IMGUI. Currently, I have uploaded all of this to [this repository](https://github.com/ghostly-developer/OpenGL-Journey).

### Improvements

Made a mesh class to make everything more streamlined and reduce the clutter of main.cpp. Planning to do much more than just drop the code onto Github and leave it there for eternity. Expect more to come soon!
