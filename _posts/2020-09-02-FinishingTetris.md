Just finished my own re-make of tetris with cpp and raylib, somehow i forgot to use the wrapper but hey it works and it works well.
Experienced a few issues building it for the web and experienced a few visual bugs on itch.io when uploaded, changelog for the upload:

- removed line blinking effect
- fixed score reset
- fixed side hit detection

Well that's it so far, i will be updating this project and i hope i'll more new stuff soon.
