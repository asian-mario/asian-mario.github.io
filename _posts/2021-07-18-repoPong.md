# Open_Pong

Open_Pong (or Pong Effect) is a game project I'm working on. It has the base fundementals of pong but with a 'modern' twist, similar to 'Tetris Effect'. It currently runs on the ROUGE Physics Engine/Game Engine and uses ROML (my own graphical maths library) for calculations. The code will be open-source but no releases will be made for it due to me planning to sell this later on if all goes well.

Foreign Dependencies:

- stb_image
- stb_truetype
- glad
- GLM (only for types, ROML handles functions)
- glfw/glf3
- IMGUI
