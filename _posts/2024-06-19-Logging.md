# ROUGE_2 : 01

Continuing my revival of my game engine ROUGE_2 after using an 'integrated' game engine to create Open_Pong using OpenGL, ROUGE_2 is planned out to be a fully fleshed out game engine with working UI's, Lighting, .fbx/.obj imports etc. For this article I am going to be delving into how I implemented several features in ROUGE_2 after revisiting and continuing this project.

## Logging

Logging is essential, not only for bug fixing but also to keep track of event triggers which are crucial in making a game, I have decided to use spdlog which can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog). First, I prepared a new Log class and created two seperate logger entities, one for the CORE (Engine Side) and one for the CLIENT/USER (User Side / Editor in the future). Using spdlog makes it extremely easy to implement fast and efficient logging, although instead of using spdlog purely I integrated it into the ROUGE2 API by using macros, not only to make it easier to call log functions but also gives the engine a faster execution time when running the log system.

**Macros:**

        //log macros - core
    #define R2_CORE_LOG_FATAL(...)	::ROUGE2::Log::GetCoreLogger()->fatal(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_CORE_LOG_ERROR(...)	::ROUGE2::Log::GetCoreLogger()->error(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_CORE_LOG_WARN(...)	::ROUGE2::Log::GetCoreLogger()->warn(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_CORE_LOG_INFO(...)	::ROUGE2::Log::GetCoreLogger()->info(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_CORE_LOG_TRACE(...)	::ROUGE2::Log::GetCoreLogger()->trace(__VA_ARGS__)

    //log macros - app
    #define R2_FATAL(...)			::ROUGE2::Log::GetClientLogger()->fatal(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_ERROR(...)			::ROUGE2::Log::GetClientLogger()->error(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_WARN(...)			::ROUGE2::Log::GetClientLogger()->warn(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_INFO(...)			::ROUGE2::Log::GetClientLogger()->info(__VA_ARGS__)
    #define R2_TRACE(...)			::ROUGE2::Log::GetClientLogger()->trace(__VA_ARGS__)

**Testing:**

    ROUGE2::Log::Init();
    R2_CORE_LOG_WARN("Initialized Logging");
    int a = 2422;
    R2_INFO("Logging Started Var={0}", a);

## Premake

Recently, every instance where I had to re-build the engine it produces .dll's in the .bin folder of the ROUGE2 engine directory but it does not directly update the .dll in the Sandbox directory, I decided to implement a build system using premake5 where I created a .lua file which allowed me to set include directories, copying files etc. for a VS2017 project (as I am using premake 5 alpha 15 it only supports VS2017 configurations at the latest).

## Events

An event system is the absoloute backbone of any Game Engine as it determines actions taken by the user and actions taken in the application, I decided to create my own system event system which is currently using a 'blocking' method which means the game engine stops function until the event is handled, although its highly inefficient at the moment I am planning to use Buffers in the near future in order to handle events asynchronously for a much more superior performance.

In order to do this I first needed to create an "Event.h" header file where I could create different Event Type's and Event Categories for identification, for the Event Category I created a bit shift method in Core.h in order to be able to assign multiple categories in one event, e.g `EventCategoryKeyboard` and `EventCategoryInput`.

    	enum class EventType {
    	None = 0,
    	WindowClose, WindowResize, WindowFocus, WindowLostFocus, WindowMoved,
    	AppTick, AppUpdate, AppRender,
    	KeyPressed, KeyReleased,
    	MouseButtonPressed, MouseButtonReleased, MouseMoved, MouseScrolled
    };

    enum EventCategory {
    	//category + BIT allows multiple category ammendment (see Core.h)
    	None = 0,
    	EventCategoryApplication = BIT(0),
    	EventCategoryInput = BIT(1),
    	EventCategoryKeyboard = BIT(2),
    	EventCategoryMouse = BIT(3),
    	EventCategoryMouseButton = BIT(4)
    };

After creating Event Dispatchers and an Event Class with Category Flags, Event Names etc. I set up three other header files for Keyboard, Mouse and Application events, most of these are not notable except for the Keyboard events where I had to take in key repeat counts when a user presses a key for an extended period of time, additionally I used key codes from the system instead of defining every key myself which would be a waste of time.

Hopefully you've enjoyed this read and stay tuned for more progress.
