Hello there! I am AsianMario [Rangga Gunarto], a 13 year old who is interested in software development & 3D Graphics! Currently, I am making projects and games to learn more about the languages that I know. The blog will be updated frequently, the posts will usually be about current or upcoming projects im working on. There are tons of things to learn so why don't you come along for the ride?
